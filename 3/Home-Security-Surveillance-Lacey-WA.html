<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the entire household will love. It's a cool trick, and one that works pretty well, but just once you have actually set up the rest of the settings. I've got a huge canine, so required to define the areas for the camera to detect i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the pet will be strolling. After a few incorrect notifies, and a very startled wife, I began to trust the system. Although anticipate a loud shock if you move it by accident! You can adjust level of sensitivity and likewise select how and when the alarm is activated (manually, quickly or after an app message), which is reasonable.</p>
