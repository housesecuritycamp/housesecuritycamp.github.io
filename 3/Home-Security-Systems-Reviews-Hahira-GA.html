Be absolutely sure you can afford it if you're going to buy something on top of a company's basic home security packages.

Smith Thompson Home Security not only offers outstanding service, we don't raise our rates. So, our consumers are very loyal!

<p>There's no devoted hub included here - each camera links straight to your router through Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there. That's a neat service, or a minimum of one that conserves a power socket and an Ethernet port, however we can't help but feel it's also the factor for the Swann's a little slow action times. Many new security companies are designed for Do It Yourself installation only. ADT remains old-fashioned by setting up each security system themselves.

<p>We do not conceal equipment costs by rolling them into a high month-to-month rate.
