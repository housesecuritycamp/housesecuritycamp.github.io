<h3>Home Alarm Monitoring Companies Bellmore NY 11710</h3>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

This isn't the most inexpensive SimpliSafe bundle, but we believe the addition of smoke protection is a plus worth paying for.</p>
