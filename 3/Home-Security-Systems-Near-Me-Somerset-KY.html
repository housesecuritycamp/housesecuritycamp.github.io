<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
<p>Camera, or closed-circuit television (CCTV), are ending up being a more and more extensive function of American life.
