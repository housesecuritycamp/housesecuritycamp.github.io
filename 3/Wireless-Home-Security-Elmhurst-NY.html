<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. Arlo Pro 2 likewise has an excellent Night Vision function. It is geared up with infrared lenses that allow the camera to tape videos even in total darkness. It has about 25 feet of visibility in the evening. As such, even if someone breaks into your home in complete darkness, you'll still have the ability to see them in your smart device app. The only concern here is that the taped footage will be black and white and a little dark so you may not have the ability to see details clearly.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
