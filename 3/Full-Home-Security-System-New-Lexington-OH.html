If you're utilizing a home automation hub to control things like lighting and thermostats, you can add a Z-Wave or Zigbee smart lock to the system without much effort. Alternately, if you do not have a home automation hub, search for a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks use standard pre-drilled holes and are relatively easy to install. Some designs use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others require that you eliminate your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
<p>We looked for Do It Yourself systems that used professional monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies supply greatly discounted or totally free hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most versatile.

No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in total control of the equipment you utilize, along with how and when you pay and utilize for monitoring services.</p>

Smart alarms are just as reliable as conventional burglar alarms but they do not always have an external siren that rests on the front of the house, which can act as a deterrent to burglars. While most wise alarms use optional monitoring services, they're not as comprehensive as those provided by conventional alarms, which typically dispatch the authorities if the alarm has been activated and not verified as a false alarm.</p>
