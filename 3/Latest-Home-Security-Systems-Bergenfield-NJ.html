A number of other designs were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of up to 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to manually stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over two months. Scout is really simple to utilize, especially if you're a fan of mobile devices.

Numerous cameras likewise use a software application zoom feature (which is not the same thing as having a physical zoom lens).</p>
<p>So far so normal. Things begin to get truly interesting with the Nest's facial acknowledgment system.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
