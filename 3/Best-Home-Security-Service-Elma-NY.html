<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

Other functions mostly add convenience, like a smart thermostat or integrations with clever light bulbs and other wise home devices. So if you wish to utilize a mobile app to close your garage door from that midtown business lunch or you simply want to adjust all the lights from your office chair, Vivint has you covered.</p>
