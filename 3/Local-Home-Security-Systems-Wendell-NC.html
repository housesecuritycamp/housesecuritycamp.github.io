Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
