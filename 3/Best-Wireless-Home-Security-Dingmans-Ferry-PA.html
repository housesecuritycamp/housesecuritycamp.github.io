<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy released by an object is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it emits.
