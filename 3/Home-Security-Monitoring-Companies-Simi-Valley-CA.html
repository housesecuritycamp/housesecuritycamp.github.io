<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and an incredible value. It receives an Outstanding score for video quality and is easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for additional cloud storage. However the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is found. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And despite having an appealing price and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
