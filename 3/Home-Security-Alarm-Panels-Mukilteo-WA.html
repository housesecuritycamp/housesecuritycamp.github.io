<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
