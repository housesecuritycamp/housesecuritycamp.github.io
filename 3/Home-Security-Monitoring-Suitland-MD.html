Ring Alarm is one of the attractive security systems on the marketplace. The design is a reflection of simpleness, and the design is tidy and sophisticated. The Ring products are long lasting and light-weight, and the keypad digits have a more vintage feel when you push them.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It requires an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensors work well.

Calling in a specialist costs more, but for those who choose to let an expert deal with the job and don't mind investing the additional money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
