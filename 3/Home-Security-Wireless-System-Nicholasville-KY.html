<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, due to the fact that it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR.

There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
