<p>I" m not pleased with this product. It needs an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I would not advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might choose to install their own systems to avoid scheduling appointments and taking some time off from work. Hiring a professional costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert manage the task and do not mind spending the additional money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>
