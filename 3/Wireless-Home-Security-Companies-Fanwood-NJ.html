Rules are required to establish a clear public understanding of such problems as whether video signals are taped, under what conditions, and for how long are they maintained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the rules would be verified and enforced; and what penalties would use to violators.</p>
