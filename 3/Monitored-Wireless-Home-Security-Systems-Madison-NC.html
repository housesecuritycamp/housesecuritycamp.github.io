<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in consumer reviews, and it provides a crisp photo up to 32 feet. And although the app and software are easy to work with, it's a little a letdown that you can't incorporate this camera with any wise home hubs or devices. A lot of clever cameras can be configured to do things like this, however few make things as basic as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives simpler and Hive's community measures up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
