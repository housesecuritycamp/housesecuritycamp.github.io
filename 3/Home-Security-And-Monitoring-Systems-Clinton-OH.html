With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
