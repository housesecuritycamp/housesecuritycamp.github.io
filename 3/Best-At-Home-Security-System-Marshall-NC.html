<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Actually irritating. Again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, since apparently they auto restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, way too costly, and not great.</p>
