The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
