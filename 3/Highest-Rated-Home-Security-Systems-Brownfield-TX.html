Due to the fact that they can often result in additional charges, the majority of users are not extremely happy with the way dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for incorrect alarms. Moreover, the total viewpoint is that the company's client service is not extremely useful when it pertains to repairing problems and recurring usage issues.
