<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive assaulter, considering that the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of information and really indirectly protects data by avoiding it from being sent. The typical factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the destructive aggressor to tape-record these codes and use various breaking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "design" security key captured during the network recovery.</p>
