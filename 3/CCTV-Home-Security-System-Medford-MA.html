<p>Houston locals have options when it concerns home security systems. You can pick a nationally acknowledged brand name or opt for a local company. Both offer similar offerings, however if you believe there's a possibility you may leave the Houston location in the future, you may be much better off partnering with a national brand that you can take with you when you move. Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera combined with a 2,000-lumen light in an entirely wire-free fixture. (You can pump that light up to 3,000 lumens by combining the battery with outdoor cabling). It also has a number of the Arlo Pro 3's features, including 2K recording, two-way audio, and a built-in siren. Also like the camera, it requires an Arlo Smart membership to store video recordings.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
<p>If you don't want to spend for your Vivint equipment in advance, you're taking a look at an agreement ranging from 42 to 60 months, which is longer than the majority of companies that require a 36-month contract. When you're in a contract, it's difficult to leave it. If you want to cancel your service, vivint charges you 100% of the remainder of your contract. But the company gives you some extra advantages if you stick to them, including a life time warranty on all equipment as long as you're registered for monitoring services.</p>
