The majority of criminals will scout through upscale suburbs looking for the easiest house to get into.

<p>There's no devoted hub involved here - each camera links straight to your router through Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.

When the feline walk past, all systems enable you to adjust the sensitivity of the motion detection and it's worth playing with these to prevent getting incorrect alarms.
