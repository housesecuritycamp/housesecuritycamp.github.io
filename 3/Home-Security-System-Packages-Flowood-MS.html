No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
