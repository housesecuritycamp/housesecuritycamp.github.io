<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
