When buying a video recorder, you should initially make sure that the gadget will work with the cameras you have actually acquired.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids consulting with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common.

With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur.
