By ordinance, just incorrect alarms caused by typhoons, tornadoes, earthquake or other disastrous events, are subject to appeal. Alarms activated by electrical storms, thunder, hail, or sudden modifications in temperature do not fulfill the standards for waiver of incorrect alarm charges. Alarms activated by unintentional but legal entry to the property, i.e. children returning home, guests, neighbors caring for the home while you are on getaway and shipment men do not meet the standard for waiver.</p>
