<p>While every property owner stresses over break-ins, uncertainty has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces frequently leading to false alarms. Do alarm systems account for burglary decreases in the United States?
