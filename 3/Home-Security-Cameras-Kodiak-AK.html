<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
