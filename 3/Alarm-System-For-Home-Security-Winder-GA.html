These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is really excellent.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on created to attend to the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared essential WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
