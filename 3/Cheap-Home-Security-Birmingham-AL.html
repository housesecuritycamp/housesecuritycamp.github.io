Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder straight which then connects to the internet and a router. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable free and battery powered.

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you want the best of whatever, you'll desire Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automatic door lock and wise thermostat for the price of equipment and $10 additional a month. We still like Vivint's basic plan if you can't pay for the extra equipment. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
