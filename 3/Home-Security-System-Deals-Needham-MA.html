The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
