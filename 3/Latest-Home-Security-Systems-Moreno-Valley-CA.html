<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". Want to add a flood sensor? A wise door lock? Your system can act as a center for up to 119 smart home devices, and can be controlled via Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TELEVISION, and more. IP cameras can also be linked to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, suggesting a more intricate setup and more wires. PoE switches are also generally regarded as a more secure method to transmit information.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>

<p>In the evening, though it lacks the complete IR LED variety of some competitors, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the fantastic motion detection.
