<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi.
