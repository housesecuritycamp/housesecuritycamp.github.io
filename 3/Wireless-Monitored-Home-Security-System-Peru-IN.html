<p>The Wyze Web cam can also record video to the cloud, but the free account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes.

If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, without any spaces in between.

<p>The genuine factor cameras are typically released is to minimize much pettier criminal offenses. However it has not even been demonstrated that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been thoroughly deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have actually found that they have actually not lowered criminal activity. "When the criminal activity and offence figures were gotten used to take account of the general downward trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were noted in particular classifications but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had actually minimized criminal offense in general in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British government).</p>
