<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
