<h3>The Best Home Alarm System Manchester Township NJ 08759</h3>
<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
