Numerous insurance companies offer discounts on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm systems.

The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of permitting three or four complimentary incorrect alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>

A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
