<h3>Home Security And Alarm Systems in North Carolina</h3>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would signal users when it spotted any kind of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would require to be a perfect storm of scenarios for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the concern.
