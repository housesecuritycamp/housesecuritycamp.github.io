When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if needed, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
