<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
