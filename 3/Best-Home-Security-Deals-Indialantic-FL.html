When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
