<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
