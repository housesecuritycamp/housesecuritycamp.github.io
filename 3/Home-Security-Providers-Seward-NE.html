<p>Arlo claims that you need to have the ability to get four to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
