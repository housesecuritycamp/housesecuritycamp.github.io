<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on developed to resolve the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
