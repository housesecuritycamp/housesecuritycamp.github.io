<p>Arlo claims that you ought to be able to get 4 to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
