<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
