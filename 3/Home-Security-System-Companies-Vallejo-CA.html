<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to leave the contract you need to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I remained in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Actually frustrating. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, because apparently they auto restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a headache, method too costly, and not terrific.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
