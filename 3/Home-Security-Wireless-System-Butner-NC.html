Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to overlook objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.
