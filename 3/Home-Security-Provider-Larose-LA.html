<p>Video recording isn't a standard option on many security systems.

These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous cops departments provide numerous "complimentary" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is substantial right from the start. The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers bring into question the appropriateness of the existing trend in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or four totally free false alarms per calendar year, since they supply no up-front rewards to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
<p>For wise home features, we recommend the ADT Pulse bundle.
