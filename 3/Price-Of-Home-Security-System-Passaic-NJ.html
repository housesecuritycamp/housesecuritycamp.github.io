<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
