<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would inform users when it spotted any type of interference. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would require to be an ideal storm of situations for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the issue. Although our screening shouldn't be taken as definitive, we believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the current system.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>

Given that alarm technology is now mostly controlled by mobile apps that inform property owners about disturbances, professional monitoring is no longer a requirement.</p>
