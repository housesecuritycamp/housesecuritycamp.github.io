<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for keeping an eye on your kids and family pets, however if you're worried about security, you do not wish to run the risk of missing a second of the action.

Even though it does not have the largest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that come with a really weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable rather thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
