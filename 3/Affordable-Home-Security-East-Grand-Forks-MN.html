<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and taking some time off from work. Employing a specialist costs more, but for those who choose to let a professional manage the task and do not mind investing the extra money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, often use battery-powered transmitters which are much easier to install and have cheaper start-up costs, but may stop working if the batteries are not maintained. Depending on range and building and construction products, one or more wireless repeaters might be required to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be moved to a new home quickly, an advantage for those who rent or who move often. The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control board and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm protects versus a burglar cutting a cable or from failures of a web provider. This complete wireless setup is typically referred to as 100% wireless.</p>
