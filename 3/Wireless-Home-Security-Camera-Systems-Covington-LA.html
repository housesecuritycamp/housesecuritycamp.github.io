<p>When it comes to home security systems, Houston residents have options. You can choose a nationally acknowledged brand or go with a local company. Both supply comparable offerings, however if you believe there's a chance you may leave the Houston location in the future, you might be better off partnering with a nationwide brand name that you can take with you when you move. Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera integrated with a 2,000-lumen light in a totally wire-free component. (You can pump that illuminate to 3,000 lumens by combining the battery with outdoor cabling).
