<p>We like the benefit and flexibility of wireless home security cameras. One of our favorites, the Arlo Pro 3, is 100% wire-free. Its Wi-Fi connection and battery make it easy to install practically anywhere a ladder can reach. Doorbell cameras have become a popular security tool. These cameras can assist monitor who's at the door and can record video when the doorbell is pushed. Doorbell cameras are a few of the most budget friendly camera choices.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
