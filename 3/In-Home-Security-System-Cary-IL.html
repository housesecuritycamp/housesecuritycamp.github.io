The equipment's all provided by 3rd parties, so what you receive might be from a different maker than the equipment your next-door neighbor got. Why's that? ADT utilizes an independent supplier design involving third-party dealerships. The dealerships figure out which equipment to utilize. Costs for systems differ. Bigger systems that provide full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most expensive choices. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most inexpensive choice.</p>
