The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
