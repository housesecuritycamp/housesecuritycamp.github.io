For instance, a four-camera system that runs 24 hr a day utilizing IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would require 2.79 terabytes of storage space for video, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

<p>Last, we also think about how much it costs to view, conserve and share tape-recorded video. While some cameras still let you see a couple of days of recorded video, the pattern has been to only let you view live video from your camera unless you register for a subscription.
