Self-monitoring a security system just suggests that the property owner, instead of a professional monitoring center, is 100% responsible for calling the authorities if and when there's an emergency.</p>
<p>No false alarm charges: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the authorities for an incorrect alarm. Since the property owner is in charge of the system, police are just contacted if there's a real emergency. On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will call authorities if a homeowner can't validate an incorrect alarm. If  authorities are gotten in touch with for an incorrect alarm, property owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching authorities needlessly. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for incorrect alarms and subsequent penalties.</p>
