This normally involves finding a spot for your camera, developing an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network. Much of them then enable you to configure the alert frequency and create activity monitoring zones, so the camera will record motion only in designated areas-- a feature we discover required for high-traffic areas, which might trigger a lot of false alerts.</p>
