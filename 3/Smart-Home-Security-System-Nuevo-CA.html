Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, included generally difficult and long contracts, and often depend on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've reviewed separately and do not suggest for the majority of people.</p>
