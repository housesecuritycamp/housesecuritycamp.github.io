<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use.

Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
