<p>Think of it this way, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more sophisticated camera be cost the low cost of forty dollars?

<p>The only real problem we have is with the cost. The bundle isn't at all cheap in the very first place, but if you wish to save 4K recordings in the cloud you'll require a higher-tier extra subscription.
