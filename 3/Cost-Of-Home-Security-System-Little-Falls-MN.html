<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I would not suggest it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and taking time off from work. Contacting a professional costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert deal with the task and don't mind spending the additional money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
<p>A base station is the hub that links all your various sensing units and devices together when it comes to home security systems. For home security cameras, a base station does the exact same thing-- however the gadgets in concern are all cameras.
