Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free.

Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the most convenient choice to install and all of the tape-recorded footage is stored in the cloud.</p>
