<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 ends up being more costly general per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't recommend it considering that its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
