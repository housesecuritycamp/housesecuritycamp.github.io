<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. Ring video security cameras are hd, however they are set to tape just when motion is discovered.

<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is instead connected directly to a network.

Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
