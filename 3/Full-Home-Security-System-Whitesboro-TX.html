<p>All persons with alarm systems safeguarding a facility in the City of Fredericksburg should have a valid alarm authorization. The integration of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single user interface provides additional details that may never have actually been possible before, such as alert of a worker, by name and identification number, going into the building.
