<h3>Residential Burglar Alarms Brownsville PA 15417</h3>
<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive total per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it considering that its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
