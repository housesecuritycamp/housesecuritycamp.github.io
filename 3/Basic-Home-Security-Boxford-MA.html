The unfortunate truth is that, yes, security cameras can be vulnerable to hacking-- but the good news is that you can do things to keep hackers out.

Without taking the correct security safety measures, you could be leaving your home available to trespassers who can jam your system and enter your home without your sensing units getting their presence.</p>
