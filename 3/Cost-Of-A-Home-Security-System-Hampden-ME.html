No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
