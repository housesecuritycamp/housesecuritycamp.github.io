These are all fairly intelligent modes, however they can not be changed. You can't alter the sensitivity of the sensing units or schedule them. This likewise leaves you vulnerable to incorrect alarms, specifically if you have small kids or family pets in your home. Some individuals choose the lack of customizability due to the fact that it makes the whole gadget extremely easy to use. However it can also be a significant limitation for some.</p>
