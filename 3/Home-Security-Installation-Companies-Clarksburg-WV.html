<p>You could spend a comparable amount for the best home security system, however they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. However, they're the very best home security cameras if you're looking for active monitoring. One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which could be a budget-friendly choice for consumers in rural areas. We advise cellular systems due to the fact that they're much more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't available. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>
