<p>When you decide what type of system you want, you need to pick what that system will consist of.

If the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic area, you won't need to worry about it taping or sending out an alert every time the canine strolls by. (We believe this is a better feature if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks regularly pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's terrific that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Webcam.</p>
<p>Lots of unmonitored security systems use self-monitored options.
