Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, since apparently they automobile restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.
