I'm not exactly sure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera carries out all that well when it's foggy or raining, particularly at night when weather conditions really mess with the night vision. Still, you're ideal about the Arlo Pro not doing anything to keep rain from hitting the lens cover.</p>
<p>Up until now so regular. Things begin to get truly interesting with the Nest's facial acknowledgment system. If the camera detects a face it does not acknowledge, it will send out a notice and photo to your phone, allowing you to consider that individual the twice.
