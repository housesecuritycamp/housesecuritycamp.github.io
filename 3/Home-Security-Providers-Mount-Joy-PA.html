<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Basically, wireless security systems depend on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work utilizing radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensing units needed to control your equipment consisting of enabling, disabling and sending you instant signals. Once a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, text, web, or e-mail portal. If your wireless home security system is expertly monitored, they'll also receive an alert to immediately assist you with emergency situation responders as required.</p>

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
