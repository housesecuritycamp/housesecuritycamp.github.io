<p>Last, we also consider how much it costs to view, conserve and share recorded video. While some cameras still let you see a couple of days of tape-recorded video, the trend has been to just let you see live video from your camera unless you sign up for a subscription. That implies you can't look back a couple of hours or days to see who was strolling through your yard. And, most membership plans also include extra functions, such as custom-made motion zones.</p>
