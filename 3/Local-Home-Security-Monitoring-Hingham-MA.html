Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to overlook items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
