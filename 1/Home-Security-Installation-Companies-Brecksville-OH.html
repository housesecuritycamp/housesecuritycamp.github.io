Meet our preferred option for home monitoring and protection: the Piper nv Smart Home Security System with Night Vision and a 180-degree Video Camera. The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's delegated the company's courteous, educated specialists. Our tester felt that the pro who installed his Vivint system was polite, prompt, and sincere (even reducing his costs after realizing they didn't need to install one camera).</p>
<p>It's disappointing that the Yi Outdoor Camera doesn't have individuals notifies that are on the company's indoor camera, because those might really cut down on alerts of bugs and cars and truck lights.

Yale is associated with home security and the yellow siren boxes are a big turn-off for prospective intruders.

<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
