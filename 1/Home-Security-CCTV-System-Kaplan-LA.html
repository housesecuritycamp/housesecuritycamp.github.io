<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function.

As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
