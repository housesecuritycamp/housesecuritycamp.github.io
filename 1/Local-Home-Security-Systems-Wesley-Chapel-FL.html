<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be useful for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut.

<p>A lot of security cameras now are quite restrictive in how you utilize them. They make you utilize a specific mobile device app, and in some cases you can't even have your own local storage.
