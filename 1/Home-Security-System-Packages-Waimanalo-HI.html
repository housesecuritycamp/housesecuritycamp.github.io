When you add wise cameras to any Blue system, and that rate jumps a lot. We like that you can pick from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, but every wise camera Blue offers is $200.</p>
<p>You could spend a similar quantity for the best home security system, but they don't monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Sentinel. However, they're the best home security cameras if you're looking for active monitoring.
