"Once the criminal activity and offence figures were gotten used to appraise the general down pattern in crimes and offenses," criminologists found in one study, "decreases were noted in specific classifications but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had actually decreased criminal offense overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British government).</p>
