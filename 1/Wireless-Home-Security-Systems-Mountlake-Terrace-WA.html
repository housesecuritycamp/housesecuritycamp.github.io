<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
