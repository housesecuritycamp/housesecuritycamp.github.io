In terms of smarts, you have motion and noise detection, and the app will notify you when either occurs (you can adjust the level of sensitivity as required).

You have to log into the web internet browser to set them all up, so you can manage them by means of the app in the future. Furthermore, the quantity of commands you can set up is very little and the reaction time is also lacking. As such, if you desire an exceptionally effective smart home alarm, this is not the one for you.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe's mobile and web app controls are also extremely basic, and don't have nearly the style or polish of some of its competitors. They finish the job, but they will not win any awards for their eye sweet. And though SimpliSafe does support setting Nest thermostats to away modes when the alarm is set and integrates with August locks, its smart home integrations aren't almost as extensive as a few of the other security systems I checked.</p>

Alder does not advertise rates for its security systems online, and considering that each consumer's private system may vary, the cost might vary also. We're not able to compare Alder to other companies regarding price, but Alder does use the fundamentals and more for protecting your home, and we believe that adds to the provider's overall worth.</p>
