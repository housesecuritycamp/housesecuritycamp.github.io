Amongst IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable totally free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the most convenient option to install and all of the taped video is saved in the cloud.</p>
