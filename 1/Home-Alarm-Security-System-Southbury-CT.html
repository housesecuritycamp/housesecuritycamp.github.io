I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter informs, for instance. However, those features come at a comparatively steep rate: $5 monthly ($50 each year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 each year) for 30 days of video history.

We believe that's costly.</p>
