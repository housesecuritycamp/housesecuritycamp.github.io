<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
