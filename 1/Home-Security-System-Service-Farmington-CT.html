<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for keeping an eye on your kids and animals, but if you're concerned about security, you don't wish to risk missing a second of the action.

Even though it does not have the widest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that featured a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug.
