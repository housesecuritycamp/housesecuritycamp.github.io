<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
