<h3>The Best Home Security in Missouri</h3>
<p>to begin with the package appeared to have actually been opened when it arrived. so then I open the cameras and whatever appeared OKAY till I started to install the cameras beyond my home and discovered one one the cameras don't work and they do not come in color. Also I had to download the user's manual cause one isn't. offered. The wires are extremely thin too. The cameras are OKAY for the rate I guess.

<p>SimpliSafe originally established its systems with renters in mind. The pieces are easy-install using adhesives. Follow installation and removal instructions to avoid any paint damage from the adhesive material.
