<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential wrongdoers are less most likely to devote criminal offense if they think they are being viewed or have a greater danger of being nabbed. This is likewise called the reasonable option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity prevention strategy, which argues that chances to upset can be minimized by modifying a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, reducing rewards from crime commission, and minimizing provocations that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the wrongdoer must understand the included surveillance for it to achieve its wanted effect.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
