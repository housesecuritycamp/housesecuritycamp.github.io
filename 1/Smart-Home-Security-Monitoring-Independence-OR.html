<h3>Residential Security Alarm Systems in Independence OR</h3>
<p>I explained that all we would require to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.
