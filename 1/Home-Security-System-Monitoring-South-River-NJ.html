<p>Most security cameras can be used both inside and outdoors. They typically have the very same functions like night vision or remote viewing, however they differ in sturdiness. Outdoor cameras must be weather condition resistant and in many cases, completely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance rating are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor options because their design allows for minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection. This will supply more accurate and less regular alerts because many times the motion detection is triggered by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
