<p>The Wyze Cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be an effective security alternative (although we liked it as a family pet cam ).

We value that the company continues to iterate and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza.

With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
