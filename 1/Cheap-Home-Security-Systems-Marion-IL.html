<h3>Top Security Systems For Homes in Marion IL</h3>
<p>If I liked the appearance of the Nest, then I enjoy the Hive View's style - undoubtedly the most aesthetically pleasing camera on this list. The handsome glossy black cube, magnetically attached to a brushed metal stand (mine was available in a lovely rose-gold but you can also get it in silver) strikes the perfect balance in between subtle and attractive adequate to not draw attention to itself.
