<p>Simply purchased a bullet ip system and definitely enjoy it. Fantastic clearness. I wished to establish viewing on my mobile phone but had a couple concerns that the tech responded to with ease. I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for instance. Nevertheless, those functions come at a relatively steep cost: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 per year) for thirty days of video history.  For each additional camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the preliminary fee.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully slow, and the range is poor. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
