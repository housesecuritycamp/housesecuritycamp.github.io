<p>Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to keep and how long you prepare to keep taped video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video when you reach the system's capability, but if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
<p>Look for a model that provides a high resolution (1080p), a wide angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety approximately 25 feet, and cost effective cloud storage for taped video. Sometimes it's helpful to be able to see what happened right before or after a visitor approaches your door.
