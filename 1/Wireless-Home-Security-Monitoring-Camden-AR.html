<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone signals with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers.
