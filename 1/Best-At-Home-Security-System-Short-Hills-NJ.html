<p>The only real issue we have is with the cost. The package isn't at all cheap in the very first place, however if you want to save 4K recordings in the cloud you'll require a higher-tier additional membership.

The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of free cloud storage (with more readily available for a month-to-month charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to appropriately find motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That likewise conserves battery life, but it may leave you with tape-recording gaps during crucial security events. If home security is your main concern, we 'd suggest among our top picks, but the Arlo is fantastic for signing in on family and pets-- or roaming felines sliding around your lawn.</p>
