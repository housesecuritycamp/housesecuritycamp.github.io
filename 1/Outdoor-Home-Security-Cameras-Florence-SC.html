<p>When it comes to how to use one, they work the same as a lot of other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup. Sometimes you do not even have to hardwire them, depending on which design you choose. Just like any security system, the more equipment you add, the more expensive it gets. Which cost jumps a lot when you include smart cameras to any Blue system. We like that you can pick from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, however every smart camera Blue offers is $200.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
<p>The type of security camera you choose will depend upon the location( s) you're wanting to safeguard. If you wish to monitor your home's exterior, vehicle, and even check in on a family pet, an outdoor camera is best as many function HD video and have weatherproof qualities. Some outdoor cameras that you'll discover today also featured deterrence features that are created to assist fend off unwelcome visitors, like an automatic light and siren. Many people do not understand how easy and hassle-free it can be to manage their alarm system from their phone. If you're smartphone smart, we extremely advise looking more into the app of the security system to make sure there is a good user experience and full control from the app.</p>
