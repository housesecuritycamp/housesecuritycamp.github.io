<p>Frontpoint provides 5 packages and 2 monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester selected the Interactive strategy but ended up dissatisfied with its absence of live video surveillance. When she received an alarm alert while on vacation, she had no chance of assessing whether her home had actually been broken into or if her feline had managed to trip the sensor. It ended up being a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop notices (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off). We likewise experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with two Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months. Scout is really easy to utilize, especially if you're a fan of mobile devices.
