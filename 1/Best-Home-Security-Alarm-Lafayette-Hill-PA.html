<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, ought to offer a minimum of a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to appropriately discover motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That also conserves battery life, however it may leave you with recording gaps during essential security occasions. If home security is your main issue, we 'd advise among our top picks, but the Arlo is excellent for signing in on family and family pets-- or stray felines slipping around your lawn.</p>
