<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to disregard objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
