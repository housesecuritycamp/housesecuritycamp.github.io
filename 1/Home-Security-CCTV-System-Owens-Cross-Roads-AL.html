<p>Now let's analyze why consumer-grade cameras are typically bad night vision performers. When a camera attempts to see in the dark, it requires a source of light to light up the location listed below it. Sadly, the night vision illuminators that feature customer cameras are created for short variety just and are of a repaired brightness. This means they generally over-expose what neighbors in a scene, causing people and things to appear burnt out" and without any information. A lot for trying to determine the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, typically are equipped with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear effectively exposed and in full information.
