<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership).

The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you stroll by.
