<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped housing that the camera beings in. Whilst these are reasonably discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this doesn't stop them from hindering lawbreakers.

<p>It worked well when we evaluated the Ring alarm equipment. The door sensing units are a bit large, which can be bothersome for doors with small or molded frames. (To neutralize this issue, Ring's released a slim magnet, which can be purchased separately.) And the $199 five-piece set doesn't have adequate equipment to protect most homes entirely.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>

<p>The cost of home security-and the value customers get for their dollar-is a crucial factor in picking which system to buy.
