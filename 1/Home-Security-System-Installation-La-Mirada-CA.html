<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can deal with every camera. Obviously, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs utilize IP cameras, however the compatibility concern extends well beyond that distinction. Some NVR systems, for instance, are compatible with the IP cameras only from particular producers and not others. When buying a video recorder, you need to first ensure that the device will work with the cameras you've bought. The cameras need to be able to provide you with the necessary information if you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system.</p>

Google has actually terminated its Works With Nest program; if you move your Nest account to a Google account, a lot of the smart home integrations with the Nest camera may no longer work. We recommend to hold back transitioning your account up until the integrations you presently use with the Nest web cam are supported within Google Home.</p>
