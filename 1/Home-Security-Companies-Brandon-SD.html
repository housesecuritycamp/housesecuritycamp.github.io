It's not important that you understand the very best home security systems like the back of your hand. But it is essential that you understand the basic rundown of the industry leaders. We're talking brand names like SimpliSafe, Frontpoint, Vivint, ADT, Deep Guard, Residence Security, Ring Alarm, Protect America, Nest Secure, and last but not least, Brinks Home Security.

Now, burglars consistently cut the telephone lines to organisations and homes, even whole neighborhoods, before breaking in.

Wyze's just recently introduced Complete Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 per month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't recommend that for home security because if it's stolen, you do not have a backup.</p>
