<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Put simply, wireless security systems rely on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work utilizing radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to get sensing units needed to manage your equipment including allowing, disabling and sending you instant alerts.
