<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder before buying.</p>
