This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

Despite the fact that it doesn't have the largest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that included a really weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>

We specifically like this camera's wide, 180-degree field of vision, since you're less likely to get a blind area anywhere you set it up.
