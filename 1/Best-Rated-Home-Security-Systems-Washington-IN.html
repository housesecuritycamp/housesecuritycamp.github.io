<p>CCTV cameras are better at catching lawbreakers after they have actually dedicated a criminal offense, instead of having the ability to stop a crime in progress. Somebody needs to be actively seeing the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to attempt to discover criminal activity before it happens.
