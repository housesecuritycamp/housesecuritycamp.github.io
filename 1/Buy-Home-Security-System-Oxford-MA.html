<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
