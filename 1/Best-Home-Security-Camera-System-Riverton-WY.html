<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in client reviews, and it provides a crisp image as much as 32 feet.

A lot of clever cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but couple of make things as basic as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives much easier and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
