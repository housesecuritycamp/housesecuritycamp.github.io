<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
