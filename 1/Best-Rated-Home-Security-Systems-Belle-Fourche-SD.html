<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, scams, and vandalism. Meet our favorite service for home monitoring and protection: the Piper nv Smart Home Security System with Night Vision and a 180-degree Video Camera. The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's delegated the company's polite, educated professionals. Our tester felt that the pro who installed his Vivint system was polite, prompt, and truthful (even decreasing his expense after understanding they didn't need to install one camera).</p>
<p>It's disappointing that the Yi Outdoor Camera doesn't have the people signals that are on the company's indoor camera, given that those might really reduce notices of bugs and automobile lights.
