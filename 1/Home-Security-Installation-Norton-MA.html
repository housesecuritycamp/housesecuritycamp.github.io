And, if you have a camera, the video recordings are sent out to a receiver that's linked to your local or cloud storage. The Nest Web cam Outdoor utilizes a separate mount, rather than an integrated one, so you're not limited to viewing one area.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
