<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Basically, wireless security systems depend on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work using radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to receive sensors required to control your equipment including allowing, disabling and sending you instant signals. Once a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, text, web, or e-mail website. If your wireless home security system is professionally monitored, they'll also receive an alert to right away assist you with emergency responders as needed.</p>

Umbrella Technologies designs intelligent video surveillance systems that exceed security cameras to help you deter hazards, examine scenarios quickly, and handle surveillance storage to offer you full protection.

Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not recommend that for home security because if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
