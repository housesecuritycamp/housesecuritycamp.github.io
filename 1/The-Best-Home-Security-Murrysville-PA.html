The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers cast doubt on the suitability of the current pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, because they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
