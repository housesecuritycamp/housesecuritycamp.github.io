<h3>Wireless Home Security Cameras in New Hampshire</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send smart device alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
