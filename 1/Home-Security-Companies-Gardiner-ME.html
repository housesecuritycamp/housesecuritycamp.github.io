<p>Clearly, there's a huge difference in between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the appeal of the latest wise items, and their accompanying control apps, is you can broaden the system as you need (or can manage) as well as incorporate everything to deal with other wise devices such as the lighting and heating, helping to develop an all-inclusive wise home, not simply an alarm system.
