<p>Although FrontPoint offers a wide range of equipment and home automation products at an affordable rate, the one location where the company especially stands out remains in DIY installation.

The first places you ought to install them ought to be covering the front door and the back entrance, and then very first flooring windows, where problem is most likely to take place.

It's simple to see how that can accumulate if you want to add a few extras. Nevertheless, it doesn't play too with other gadgets and products, like those with Z-Wave and Zigbee compatibility, and you can't automate specific commands through IFTTT (If This Then That) yet.

<p>We searched for Do It Yourself systems that offered professional monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies provide totally free or heavily affordable hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we found no-contract systems to be the most versatile.

No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in total control of the equipment you use, along with how and when you use and pay for monitoring services.</p>
