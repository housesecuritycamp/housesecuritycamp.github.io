<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies provide "free monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Many insurer provide discount rates on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments use several "free" incorrect alarms prior to imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is substantial right from the start.

The video footage works as a complement to - however not a replacement for - eyewitness evidence in the courtroom.</p>
