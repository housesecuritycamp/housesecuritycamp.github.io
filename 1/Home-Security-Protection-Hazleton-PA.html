<p>For those who are still worried about their security system being hacked into, there are actions that can be required to decrease the risk. The first of them is to secure the system. Set up firewalls, check for firmware updates, use a strong password, regularly change old passwords, and get devices that support two-factor authentication. Make certain to keep a check on your camera logs and prevent accessing your security system from a public WiFi network. Think about that wired systems are much less vulnerable to hacking if the hazard of being hacked is still a significant issue.</p>
