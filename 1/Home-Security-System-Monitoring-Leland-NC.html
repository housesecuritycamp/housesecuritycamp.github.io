<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras minimize criminal activity. Camera systems help discourage criminal offense and lower liability by providing an unbiased record of events. They can be set up on the exterior or interior of a building to monitor sensitive areas such as entryways, parking lots, money spaces, or secure areas of a building.

<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces.
