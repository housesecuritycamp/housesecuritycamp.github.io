<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
