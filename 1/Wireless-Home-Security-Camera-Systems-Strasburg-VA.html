<h3>Security Alarm System in Strasburg VA</h3>
<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, which camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

These companies have the ability to get activity alerts and assess the circumstance from another location. ADT's six customer monitoring centers (more than any other security company has) ensure your security never ever goes offline. If one monitoring station deals with an interruption of service, your home's protection is quickly moved to another center.</p>
