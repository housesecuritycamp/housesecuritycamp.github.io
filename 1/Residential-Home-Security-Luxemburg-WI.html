So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, since apparently they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.

The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to save and how long you plan to keep documented footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly.

<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video.
