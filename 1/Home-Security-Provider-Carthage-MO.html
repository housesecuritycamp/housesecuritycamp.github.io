The response depends upon a number of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to store and how long you plan to keep taped video.

This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
