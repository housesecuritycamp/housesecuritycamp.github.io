Normally, you either have professional monitoring all the time or you don't have it at all. But Home lets you sign on for expert monitoring for short stints (3 or 7 days). Next time you go on vacation, you can let someone else watch on your system.</p>

If the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic location, you won't need to worry about it recording or sending out an alert whenever the canine strolls by. (We think this is a more valuable function if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles regularly pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's great that it's not necessary, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Camera.</p>
