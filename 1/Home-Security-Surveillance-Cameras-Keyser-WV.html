The equipment's all offered by 3rd parties, so what you receive may be from a various producer than the equipment your neighbor received. Why's that? ADT utilizes an independent supplier model including third-party dealers. The dealerships figure out which equipment to use. Costs for systems vary. Bigger systems that offer full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most costly options. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most inexpensive option.</p>
<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision alternative, however the black and white variation can actually be clearer and provide you higher-quality video footage.
