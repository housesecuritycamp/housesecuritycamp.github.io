<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature.

In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop.
