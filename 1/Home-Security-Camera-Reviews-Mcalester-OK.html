Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you stroll by.
