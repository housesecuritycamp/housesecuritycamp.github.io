<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, need to offer at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more readily available for a month-to-month cost ).
