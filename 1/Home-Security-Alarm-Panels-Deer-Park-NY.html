Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you walk by.
