<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire family will enjoy. It's a neat trick, and one that works quite well, but just once you have actually set up the rest of the settings. I have actually got a big canine, so needed to specify the locations for the camera to spot i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the pet will be walking. After a couple of false alerts, and a very startled partner, I started to trust the system. Although expect a loud shock if you move it by accident!

<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And despite having an attractive cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
