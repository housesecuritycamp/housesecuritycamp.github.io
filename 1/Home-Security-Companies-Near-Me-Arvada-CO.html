<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by.
