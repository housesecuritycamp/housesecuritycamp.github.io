<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
