I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter notifies, for example. However, those functions come at a relatively high cost: $5 each month ($50 each year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 per year) for 1 month of video history.
