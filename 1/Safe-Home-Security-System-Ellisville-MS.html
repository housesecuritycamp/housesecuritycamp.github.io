Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you stroll by.
