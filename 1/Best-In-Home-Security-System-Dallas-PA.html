With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
