<p>There are two outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped.

These systems often cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Spending for the equipment in advance supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as many times as you want.</p>
