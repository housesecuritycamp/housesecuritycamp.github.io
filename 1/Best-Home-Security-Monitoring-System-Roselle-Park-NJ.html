<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in customer reviews, and it delivers a crisp picture up to 32 feet. And despite the fact that the app and software are easy to work with, it's a little a letdown that you can't incorporate this camera with any wise home hubs or gizmos. A lot of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as easy as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives much easier and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function without any frustration.</p>
