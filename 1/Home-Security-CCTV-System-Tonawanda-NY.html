<p>We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were typically missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard wise home gadgets like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and check that you locked your doors.

<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
