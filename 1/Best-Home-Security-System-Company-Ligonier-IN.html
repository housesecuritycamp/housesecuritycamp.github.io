<p>Home security should never ever be restricted by where you can position or power your cameras, inside or outdoors. While we always encourage main station service, some security system owners do not need or desire a central station involved. Alarm Grid's self monitoring strategies are less expensive and allow access to the fantastic functions offered by Overall Connect,, or Telguard without being connected to the main station.
