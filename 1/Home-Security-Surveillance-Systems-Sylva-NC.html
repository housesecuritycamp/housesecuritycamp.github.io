<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function.

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
