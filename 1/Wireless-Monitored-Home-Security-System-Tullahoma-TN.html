Even though it doesn't have the largest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that included a truly weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cable rather thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
