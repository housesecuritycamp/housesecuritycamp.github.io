<p>DITEK's alarm system surge protectors safeguard your security system versus short-term surges that can go into through AC power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. It's not almost security from theft, either. Adam Kostecki, the senior assistant vice president of digital services and development at Amica, advises sensing units that focus on things you would not otherwise see, like leak sensors or freeze sensing units. Given advantages like that and the more direct abilities of monitoring and securing your home, it may be the right time to upgrade your security. SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. However while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems do not.

If you currently have a security device from another brand name, like a Blink XT camera, it probably won't deal with your SimpliSafe system.</p>
