<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal worth. It gets an Excellent rating for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership prepare for extra cloud storage. However the company does offer a Total Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is discovered. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And despite having an attractive rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
