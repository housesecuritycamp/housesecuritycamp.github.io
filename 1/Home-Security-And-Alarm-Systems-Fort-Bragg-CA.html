<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for watching on your family pets and kids, however if you're concerned about security, you do not want to run the risk of missing a second of the action.

Although it does not have the largest operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that come with a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug.
