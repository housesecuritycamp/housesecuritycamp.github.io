<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR.
