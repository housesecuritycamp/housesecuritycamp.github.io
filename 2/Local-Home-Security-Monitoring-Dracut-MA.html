Like many home security companies, Vivint's equipment can be pricey, and paying at least $600 at the time of purchase may not fit into your spending plan. If you can swing it, nevertheless, month-to-month service is more flexible than a long-term agreement-- and assists you avoid prospective termination fees. Wrongdoers have no embarassment.

<p>We looked for DIY systems that used expert monitoring, both with and without a contract.
