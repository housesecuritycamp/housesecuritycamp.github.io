<p>ADT might be well known, but it's confusing and likewise costly. ADT doesn't list its monitoring and equipment prices online, so you have to hire prior to you have any idea just how much a system might cost.

<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, because it includes 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio.

That person at Deep Guard's center can alert a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they refuse to engage or leave in a criminal act.

<p>So what happens if something triggers your alarm but you're in a meeting with a vendor and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service implies you don't get informed up until the next day?

However these combinations aren't rather as robust as the house or Ring systems.</p>
