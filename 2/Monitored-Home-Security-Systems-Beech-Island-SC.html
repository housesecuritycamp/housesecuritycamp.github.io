Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensing unit, smart lock, and so on), I want to make certain that they all easily interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>

So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notices and live views were painfully slow, and the range is bad. Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
