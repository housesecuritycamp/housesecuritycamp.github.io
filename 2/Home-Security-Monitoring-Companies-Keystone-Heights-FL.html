<p>Although FrontPoint provides a variety of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable rate, the one location where the company especially stands out remains in DIY installation. CCTV security cameras require to be installed in the ideal areas to capture the essential goings-on of your home or business.

<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, due to the fact that it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It needs an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I would not advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may prefer to install their own systems to avoid scheduling consultations and taking time off from work. Employing a professional costs more, but for those who choose to let an expert manage the task and don't mind spending the extra money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>
