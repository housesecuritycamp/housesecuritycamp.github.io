<p>GO2 offers full-service Video Surveillance Installation of high definition (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Buying burglar security systems and devices from eBay really makes alarm companies run away from a sale. A lot of alarm companies would rather supply and install their own equipment rather than go through this inconvenience. For the most extensive protection of your residential or commercial property, you desire something that includes night vision and can tape-record at a good quality - and practically all cameras now include a minimum of HD (1080p) resolution. Some, like our existing top security camera recommendation the Arlo Ultra, go up from that to deliver 4K resolution.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
