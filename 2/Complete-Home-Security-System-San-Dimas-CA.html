<h3>Wireless House Alarm in San Dimas CA</h3>
<p>I described that all we would need to do is tap into any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.
