When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone informs with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

<p>Wireless security cameras being tested in a Consumer Reports laboratory. If you do come across a home invasion emergency, you can activate the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas numerous other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm should be enough to scare away intruders for the most part. Security cameras are a great start to securing your home.
