<p>A lot of systems include door, window, motion, and ecological sensing units plus cameras for live video surveillance.

<p>During the night, though it lacks the full IR LED variety of some rivals, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight available if you're placing it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the great motion detection. Not just is the Arlo quick to pick out moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's looking at. Simply a couple decades earlier, the home security industry was dominated by a couple of huge names providing expensive, stiff plans with little versatility and unfriendly, long-term contracts. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensing units linked to a keypad control panel and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has all altered.</p>

Luckily, there are many systems on the market that offer homeowners the power to self-monitor, which suggests they can monitor their own home. A self-monitored system provides property owners protection and peace of mind without the cost of a monitoring company. Since alarm technology is now largely managed by mobile apps that inform homeowners about disruptions, expert monitoring is no longer a requirement.</p>
