Any home security camera worth its salt will support motion detection. However you can't buy this camera on its own-- you need to contribute to a complete Vivint home security system.</p>
<p>In the evening, though it lacks the full IR LED range of some rivals, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're putting it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the great motion detection. Not just is the Arlo fast to select moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out precisely what it's looking at. Simply a couple decades earlier, the home security industry was dominated by a few big names providing expensive, rigid plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-lasting agreements. Systems were restricted to a couple wired motion sensing units linked to a keypad control panel and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has all changed.</p>
