<p>Arlo declares that you must be able to get four to six months out of a fully charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature level.

If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
