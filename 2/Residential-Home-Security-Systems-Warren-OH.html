The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
