<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function.

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
