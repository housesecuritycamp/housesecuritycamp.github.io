Outdoor cameras ought to be weather condition resistant and in some cases, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most long lasting. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor alternatives due to the fact that their style enables minimum glare.
