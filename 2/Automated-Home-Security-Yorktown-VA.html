<h3>Best Home Security Companies in Virginia</h3>
<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>CCTV cameras are much better at capturing bad guys after they have dedicated a criminal offense, instead of being able to stop a criminal activity in development. Someone has to be actively watching the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to attempt to detect criminal activity before it takes place.
