<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
