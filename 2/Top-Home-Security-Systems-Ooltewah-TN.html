<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop notifications (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off).

Scout is really simple to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it permits you to control nearly every element of the security system remotely, and it's extremely personalized.

Make sure to take this recurring cost into account prior to making your final decision.</p>
