While monitored systems are more extensive and do the majority of the work for you, an unmonitored system counts on somebody responsible (we're taking a look at you) to assist do some of the work.

This implies they normally over-expose what neighbors in a scene, causing individuals and items to appear burnt out" and without any detail. So much for attempting to recognize the bad guys. Commercial cameras, however, typically are equipped with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness automatically to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear effectively exposed and in full detail. If a camera can not record and deliver a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and in the evening, it has restricted effectiveness.</p>
