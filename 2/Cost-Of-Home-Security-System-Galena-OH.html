IP cameras that are connected to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.
