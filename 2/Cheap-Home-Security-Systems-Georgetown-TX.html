Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
