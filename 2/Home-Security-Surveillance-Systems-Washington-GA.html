<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
