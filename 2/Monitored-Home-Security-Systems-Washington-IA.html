A lot of wireless home security systems are Do It Yourself and simple to link using 'how-to' videos or the provider's manual.

In the London subway battles in 2005, terrorists carried bombs onto buses and trains, detonating them during rush hour.

The terrorists were tape-recorded on numerous CCTV cameras, however sadly they were neither observed nor intercepted before they were able to perform the attacks.</p>
