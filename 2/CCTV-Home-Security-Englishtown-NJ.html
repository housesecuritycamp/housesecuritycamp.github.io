<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
