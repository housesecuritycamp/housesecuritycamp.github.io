<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand out too much. Pretty easy to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from far from your house. The 2nd important thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably ear-piercing in-built alarm, so it functions as a home alarm system in addition to a security camera. That separates it from the products I have actually already written, and assists in part to discuss its price.</p>
<p>Efficient in running in both normal and improperly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can catch clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips. For this reason, these cameras are ideal for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are not able to work optimally. Not only does Ring (now owned by Amazon) make video doorbells, it makes security cameras too: here we're chosen the wireless, battery powered model, but there is a wired variation too if you don't wish to worry about ever needing to recharge the batteries.</p>
