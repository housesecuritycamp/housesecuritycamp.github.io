However, it does not play too with other gadgets and products, like those with Z-Wave and Zigbee compatibility, and you can't automate particular commands through IFTTT (If This Then That) yet. Just as with the redesigned equipment, this home automation update puts it in league with competitors-- especially those with DIY installation.</p>
