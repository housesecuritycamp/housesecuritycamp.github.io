The Alarm Department manager will determine whether to give the appeal with periodic consultation with the Director.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

<p>Motion sensors use backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. However they only operate when you run out the house. Do not believe they'll safeguard you if someone goes into when you're sleeping! Rather the opposite, your alarm system really disregards motion sensor signals if you arm the system however stay at home. If the system worked any other method, it would false alarm each time you strolled into a secured space.</p>
<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is decent. The motion sensing units work well. I would not recommend it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time may prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling visits and taking some time off from work. Hiring a professional costs more, however for those who choose to let a professional manage the job and don't mind investing the extra money, expert installation is the method to go.</p>
