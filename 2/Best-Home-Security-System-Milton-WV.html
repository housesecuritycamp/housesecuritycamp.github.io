<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
