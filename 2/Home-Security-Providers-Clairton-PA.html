<p>It's disappointing that the Yi Outdoor Camera doesn't have individuals signals that are on the company's indoor camera, considering that those might actually minimize notifications of bugs and vehicle lights.

Yale is associated with home security and the yellow siren boxes are a huge turn-off for would-be intruders.

<p>Flood lights are frequently used in combination with motion detectors. When sensing units detect movement, the lights light up the surrounding area, which will allow you to see who is on your property and will possibly scare off intruders.

<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Of course, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that difference. Some NVR systems, for instance, are compatible with the IP cameras just from certain manufacturers and not others. When purchasing a video recorder, you must initially ensure that the gadget will deal with the cameras you've bought. If you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras need to be able to supply you with the needed details.</p>
<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to buying.</p>
