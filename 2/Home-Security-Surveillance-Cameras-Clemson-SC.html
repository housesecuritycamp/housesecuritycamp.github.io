<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services using convenience, assurance and fulfillment to every client and are devoted to satisfying our consumer's requirements with stability, honesty, interest and outstanding service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually progressed into the extremely advanced yet budget friendly systems available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
