<h3>Motion Activated Security Camera in Orland Park IL</h3>

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>

<p>Video recording isn't a standard option on a lot of security systems.

Video files are big, which suggests a lot of area is required. There are a handful of companies that use complimentary video storage, but the video is sent out to a cloud account and only kept for a few days. For longer access to video, anticipate to pay a monthly storage cost.</p>
<p>Though Vivint's sensors are wireless, the control panel does need to be set up by a connected and professional to a source of power.
