<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". Most wireless home security systems are DIY and easy to connect utilizing 'how-to' videos or the provider's manual. Although you will not have an expert install your security equipment, you'll save cash from installation expenses. And when you're prepared to move, simply evacuate your equipment and re-install it without untangling wires or arranging a technician. In the London subway bombings in 2005, terrorists carried bombs onto buses and trains, detonating them during heavy traffic. After the terrible attacks, cops evaluated CCTV camera video and saw the terrorists going into the train station, carrying backpacks packed with explosives. The terrorists were recorded on a number of CCTV cameras, but sadly they were neither discovered nor intercepted before they were able to carry out the attacks.</p>
