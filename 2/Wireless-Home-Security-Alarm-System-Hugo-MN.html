<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
