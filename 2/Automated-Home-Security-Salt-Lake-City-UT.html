Wyze's recently introduced Complete Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't suggest that for home security due to the fact that if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
