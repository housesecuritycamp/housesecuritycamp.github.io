<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
<p>The main differences between the 2 systems are wires and pricing. Due to the fact that it's in the title of the 2 systems, the wires are obvious.

Wireless systems count on batteries rather of wires. So, you will need to replace and recharge the batteries, but the system will not tie you to your home.</p>
