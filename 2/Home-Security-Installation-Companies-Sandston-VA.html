This indicates they generally over-expose what neighbors in a scene, triggering people and things to appear blown out" and with no detail. So much for trying to recognize the bad people. Commercial cameras, however, typically are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness immediately to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear properly exposed and in full information. If a camera can not catch and deliver a properly-exposed and sharp  image throughout the day and at night, it has actually restricted usefulness.</p>
