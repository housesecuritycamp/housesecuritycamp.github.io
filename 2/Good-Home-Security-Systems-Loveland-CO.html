While the rate of robberies nationally has actually reduced, the average loss has actually increased-- in 2018, that number was close to $3,0002 (more on that in the break-in data area above).</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
