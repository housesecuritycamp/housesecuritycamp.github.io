<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
<p>Recording the video from your security cameras requires hard disks or cloud based storage.

If your dealing with taped video storage on an IP camera system, then your network video recorder (NVR) can use disk drives for on-site recording and cloud-based recording in the event of hard drive breakdown.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
