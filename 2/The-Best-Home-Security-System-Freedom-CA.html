SimpliSafe responded with a statement stating the system would notify users when it discovered any kind of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would require to be an ideal storm of scenarios for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the concern.

Typically, CCTV is most reliable as an active system, with a guard monitoring the passages and somebody else, somewhere, watching video surveillance displays for assistance. Everything is synchronized and whatever takes place in real time.</p>
