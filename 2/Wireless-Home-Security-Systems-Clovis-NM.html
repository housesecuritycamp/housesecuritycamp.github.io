<p>All individuals with alarm securing a facility in the City of Fredericksburg must have a legitimate alarm permit. The combination of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural convergence of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface uses additional information that might never ever have actually been possible previously, such as notice of a worker, by name and identification number, going into the structure. A picture of that employee is presented on screen for confirmation (verifying it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating occurs.</p>
<p>Limited features - A number of the advanced functions now available with IP cameras (for example: megapixel resolution, digital zoom, and video analytics), aren't offered in analog CCTV designs.
