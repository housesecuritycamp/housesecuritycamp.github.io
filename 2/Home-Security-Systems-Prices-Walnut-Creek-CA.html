<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi cameras are easier to install than their wired counterparts because they do not need to be located near an Ethernet port and do not need electrical wiring.

Bluetooth cameras are likewise simple to install, but you have to stay within 40 feet or two to link to them with your phone.</p>
