<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". Most wireless home security systems are Do It Yourself and simple to connect using 'how-to' videos or the provider's handbook. Although you will not have an expert install your security equipment, you'll conserve money from installation costs. And when you're ready to move, simply pack up your equipment and re-install it without untangling wires or scheduling a technician. In the London subway bombings in 2005, terrorists brought bombs onto buses and trains, detonating them during rush hour. After the terrible attacks, police evaluated CCTV camera video footage and saw the terrorists getting in the train station, carrying knapsacks packed with explosives.

We suggest cellular systems since they're much more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't offered.

Given that, its benefits - avoiding at many a couple of street criminal activities, and probably none - are disproportionately small.</p>
