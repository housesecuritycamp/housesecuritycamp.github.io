<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective wrongdoers are less most likely to devote crime if they believe they are being enjoyed or have a greater threat of being apprehended. This is also called the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime prevention method, which argues that chances to offend can be minimized by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being captured, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, decreasing rewards from criminal activity commission, and reducing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the culprit should be aware of the included surveillance for it to attain its wanted impact.</p>
<p>The Randolph Area Cops Department is asking businesses and homeowners to register their privately-owned surveillance camera systems.
