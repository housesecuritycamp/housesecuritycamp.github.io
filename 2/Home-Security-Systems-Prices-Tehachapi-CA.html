<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion.
