<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is decent. The motion sensors work well.
