<h3>DVR Security Camera System San Luis Obispo CA 93405</h3>
<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and add another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 ends up being more pricey overall per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it given that its battery-saving regimens can disrupt efficiency.</p>
