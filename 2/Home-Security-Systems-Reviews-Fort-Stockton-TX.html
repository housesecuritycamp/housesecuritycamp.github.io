In long-lasting testing of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
