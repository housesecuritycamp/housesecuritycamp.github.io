<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a terrific security camera and a sensational value. It receives an Excellent score for video quality and is easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for additional cloud storage. But the company does offer a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is discovered. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And despite having an attractive price and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
