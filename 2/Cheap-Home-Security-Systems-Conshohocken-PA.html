<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services using convenience, assurance and satisfaction to every client and are committed to satisfying our consumer's needs with integrity, honesty, enthusiasm and exceptional service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning a number of years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually evolved into the extremely advanced yet budget friendly systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>The only method to keep communication genuinely secure is to utilize end-to-end encryption For example, when accessing an internet bank, one would almost always use strong file encryption from the web internet browser and all the way to the bank - therefore it shouldn't be risky to do banking over an unencrypted wireless network. The argument is that anyone can sniff the traffic uses to wired networks too, where system administrators and possible hackers have access to the links and can read the traffic. Also, anybody understanding the secrets for an encrypted wireless network can get to the information being moved over the network.</p>
