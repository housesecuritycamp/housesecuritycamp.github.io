<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
<p>CR's take: The TP-Link Kasa Camera is a fantastic camera that costs far less than much of its rivals. It offers excellent video quality and even earns an Outstanding rating for action time.

With a Kasa Care plan, you can get up to 30 days of cloud video storage.</p>
