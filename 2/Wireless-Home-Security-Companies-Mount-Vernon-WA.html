<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for watching on your kids and animals, but if you're concerned about security, you don't wish to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we recommend the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which supplies continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with choices for more via subscription. Despite the fact that it doesn't have the best operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that included a truly weatherproof cable and plug.
