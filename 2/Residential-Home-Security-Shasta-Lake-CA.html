<p>I explained that all we would need to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
