<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
