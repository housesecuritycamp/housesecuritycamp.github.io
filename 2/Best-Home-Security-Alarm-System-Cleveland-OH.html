<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, because it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds pricey, however it's not a lot when you think about that a live person is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras find suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Sentinel's center can alert a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act.
