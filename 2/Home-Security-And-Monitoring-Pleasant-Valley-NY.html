<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it detected any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would alert users. The company likewise questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a perfect storm of scenarios for someone to effectively hack the system.
