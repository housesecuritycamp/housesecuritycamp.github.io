This innovation (a) has the prospective change the core experience of going out in public in America because of its chilling result on people, (b) carries very genuine threats of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not considerably secure us versus terrorism. Given that, its benefits - preventing at the majority of a few street criminal activities, and probably none - are disproportionately small.</p>
