<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is quickly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so essential?  For starters, Deep Knowing enables somebody to find what they are trying to find without having to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Envision a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the components you are looking for in the recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we merely type police" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police car appears.

Look at the ceiling of customer electronic devices shops and storage facility chains and you will notice in each aisle a white dome camera that is larger than the average customer camera. Let that sink in for a minute ... these companies do not even utilize the kind of cameras they are selling to the general public, and there is a good reason why.</p>
