<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
