<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
