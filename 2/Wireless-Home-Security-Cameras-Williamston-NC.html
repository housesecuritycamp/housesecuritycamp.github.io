<p>No incorrect alarm penalties: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the authorities for a false alarm. Considering that the homeowner supervises of the system, police are just called if there's a real emergency.

<p>The genuine reason cameras are typically released is to minimize much pettier criminal activities. But it has not even been demonstrated that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been thoroughly deployed in public places, sociologists studying the problem have actually found that they have not reduced criminal offense. "When the criminal activity and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the general down pattern in criminal offenses and offences," criminologists discovered in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in certain categories but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had minimized criminal offense in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the worry of crime (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British government).</p>
