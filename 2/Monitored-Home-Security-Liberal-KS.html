<p>It worked well when we evaluated the Ring alarm equipment. The door sensing units are a bit big, which can be inconvenient for doors with molded or small frames.

<p>Everybody we handled at NSS were very handy and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we wanted, and they carried out with professionalism and competence.
