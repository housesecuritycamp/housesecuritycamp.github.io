<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
