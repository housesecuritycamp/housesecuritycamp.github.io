If there are 3 choose emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single set camera can only see one. This creates a one in three opportunity of catching a particular incident on video (either live or tape-recorded). The command center also included a computer system designated for submitting event reports online. These can be accessed by management personnel at a later date from a database through the computer network.</p>
