Modern systems now have remarkable capabilities", though these have actually developed easy to understand misgivings about the risk for privacy and prospective abuse such abilities develop.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR.
