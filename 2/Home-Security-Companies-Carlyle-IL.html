<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to ignore objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
