<p>After purchasing, installing, and using these systems for 8 months, we found 4 standout companies. Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all supply an impressive customer experience and instinctive, ingenious security tech.

ADT offers exceptional brand name recognition (an effective crime deterrent), Vivint aces home automation, and Frontpoint uses a high-support choice for those who desire a streamlined, DIY system.</p>
<p>Saving uncompressed digital recordings uses up an enormous amount of hard disk space, and a few hours of uncompressed video could quickly fill up a hard disk drive.
