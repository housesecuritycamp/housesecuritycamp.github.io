We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of approximately 90 seconds between videos.</p>

<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for keeping an eye on your pets and kids, however if you're worried about security, you do not want to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we suggest the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage for free, with options for more through subscription. Despite the fact that it does not have the best operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that included a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord quite thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
<p>At night, though it does not have the complete IR LED array of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight available if you're putting it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the fantastic motion detection. Not only is the Arlo fast to pick out moving products, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out precisely what it's taking a look at.
