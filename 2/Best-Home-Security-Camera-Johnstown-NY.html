<p>Home security systems and modern wise home abilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone.

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
