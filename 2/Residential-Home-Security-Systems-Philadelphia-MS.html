<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
