This usually involves discovering an area for your camera, producing an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that enables more light to enter the camera's sensor. The more light that is permitted to go into the camera the brighter the image will be. Nevertheless, even these low light capable cameras have digital noise that make the dark image look fuzzy. To combat this fuzzy image some security cameras come equipped with 2D and 3D digital sound reduction Some security cameras now include infrared light that is unnoticeable to the human eye but can be picked up by a security camera's sensor.</p>
