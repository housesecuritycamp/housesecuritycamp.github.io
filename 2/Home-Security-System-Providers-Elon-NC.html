Both the initial House system and the Residence Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we checked that also deals with HomeKit.

<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. If your camera identifies motion or noise, you can set off a video clip or a SmartThings automation. This series of occasions likewise operates in reverse. For example, if someone opens your front door when your SmartThings system is set to away," you can tape a clip and sound your Arlo siren (which happens to be the loudest of the 3 sirens). Or, if Arlo Pro spots a noise, you can have your lights set to switch on.
