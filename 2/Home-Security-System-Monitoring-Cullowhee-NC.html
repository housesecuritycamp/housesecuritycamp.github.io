<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch.
