If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
