<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
