<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send smartphone alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV).

Employing a technician costs more, but for those who prefer to let a professional manage the job and don't mind spending the money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>
