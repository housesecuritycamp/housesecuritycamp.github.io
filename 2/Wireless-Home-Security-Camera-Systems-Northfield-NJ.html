<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
