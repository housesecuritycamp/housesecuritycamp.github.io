<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and fraud. Meet our favorite option for home monitoring and protection: the Piper nv Smart Home Security System with Night Vision and a 180-degree Video Camera. The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's delegated the company's polite, experienced specialists.
