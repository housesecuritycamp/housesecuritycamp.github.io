<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
