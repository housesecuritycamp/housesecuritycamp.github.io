<p>During the night, though it does not have the full IR LED selection of some competitors, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the fantastic motion detection. Not only is the Arlo quick to choose moving products, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out precisely what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple years earlier, the home security industry was dominated by a couple of huge names offering pricey, rigid plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-term agreements. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensors connected to a keypad control panel and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has actually all altered.</p>
