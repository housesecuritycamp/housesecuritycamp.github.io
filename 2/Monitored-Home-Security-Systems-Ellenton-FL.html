<p>During the night, though it lacks the complete IR LED range of some rivals, the Arlo catches enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight available if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the fantastic motion detection. Not only is the Arlo quick to select moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple years back, the home security market was controlled by a couple of huge names using costly, rigid strategies with little versatility and hostile, long-term agreements.
