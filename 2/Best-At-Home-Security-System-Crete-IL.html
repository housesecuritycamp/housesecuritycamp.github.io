<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further electrical wiring.
