<p>Most security cameras can be used both inside and outdoors. They usually have the very same functions like night vision or remote watching, but they vary in toughness. Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and sometimes, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance rating are the most long lasting. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices since their style permits minimum glare.
